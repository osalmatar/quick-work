The output of archived_trades is missing either Buy Price or Target. They are mutually exclusive in the output. They are mutually exclusive in the ew_conv file. However, the records transferred to archived_trades should be those of trade_journal with the target being from ew_conv instead of from trade_journal. The row in archived_trades should have both Buy Price and Target. Again, the Buy Price is from ew_conv, and the Target from trade_journals; note that when ew_conv has a target for the ticker, the Buy Price will be empty, but it should be present in trade_journals from previous readings.
